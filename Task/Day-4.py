You are an intelligent assistant trained to break down complex information into logical steps.
Your task is to read the article below, decompose it into smaller reasoning steps (step-by-step),
and then provide a final summary based on your reasoning.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the article step-by-step.
2. Ensure each step builds toward understanding the whole.
3. End with a concise and clear summary.

Article:
{text}

Now begin your chain of thought and final summary:
"""

    elif technique == "Tree-of-Thought":
        return f"""
You are an AI assistant that processes information by exploring multiple lines of reasoning.
For the given article, generate a tree of ideas ‚Äî think through different branches (e.g., causes, effects, viewpoints, examples).
Summarize insights from these branches into a cohesive final summary.

Instructions:
- Branch 1: Identify main themes or ideas.
- Branch 2: Examine consequences or implications.
- Branch 3: Explore any counterpoints or contrasts.
- Combine all insights into a final summary.

Article:
{text}

Think in branches and provide your final summary:
"""

    elif technique == "Role-based":
        return f"""
You are a professional journalist with a background in editorial writing.
Your job is to read the given article, understand its essence, and write a polished, objective,
and informative summary suitable for a national newspaper.

Instructions:
- Maintain professional and neutral tone.
- Eliminate fluff, focus on facts and key points.
- Aim for clarity and readability for a broad audience.

Article:
{text}

Now write your journalist-style summary:
"""

    elif technique == "ReAct":
        return f"""
You are a reasoning assistant that follows the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework:
First, think through the problem (Thought), then take action (Action), then reflect on what you observed (Observation).

Your task is to:
1. Use reasoning to understand the article.
2. Identify and summarize key points.
3. Reflect on important observations and finalize a summary.

Format:
Thought: [Write your reasoning]
Action: [Summarize the key ideas]
Observation: [Reflect and conclude]
Final Summary: [Your complete summary]

Article:
{text}

Start your ReAct reasoning now:
"""

    elif technique == "Directional Stimulus":
        return f"""
You are an assistant trained to understand directional relationships such as cause-and-effect.
Read the article and identify:
- What actions or events caused what outcomes.
- Relationships like if-then, due to, as a result, which led to, etc.
Use these patterns to construct a cause-effect map and generate a summary.

Instructions:
1. Extract major causes and their effects.
2. Highlight logical sequences of change or progression.
3. Conclude with a summary emphasizing the causal structure.

Article:
{text}

Now analyze cause-effect and give your summary:
"""

    elif technique == "Step-Back":
        return f"""
You are an expert summarizer trained in reflective thinking.
Step back from the details and understand the overall message, purpose, and context of the article.
Then, write a clear and meaningful summary based on that high-level understanding.

Instructions:
1. Identify the central idea or theme.
2. Understand the purpose or goal of the content.
3. Avoid over-focusing on minor details.
4. Provide a big-picture summary.

Article:
{text}

Now step back and summarize the big picture:
