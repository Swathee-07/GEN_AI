Abstract: Climate change is a global threat to the food and nutritional security of the world. As
greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere are increasing, the temperature is also rising due to
the greenhouse effect. The average global temperature is increasing continuously and is predicted
to rise by 2C until 2100, which would cause substantial economic losses at the global level. The
concentration of CO 2, which accounts for a major proportion of greenhouse gases, is increasing
at an alarming rate, and has led to higher growth and plant productivity due to increased photo-
synthesis, but increased temperature offsets this effect as it leads to increased crop respiration rate
and evapotranspiration, higher pest infestation, a shift in weed Ô¨Çora, and reduced crop duration.
Climate change also affects the microbial population and their enzymatic activities in soil. This paper
reviews the information collected through the literature regarding the issue of climate change, its
possible causes, its projection in the near future, its impact on the agriculture sector as an inÔ¨Çuence
on physiological and metabolic activities of plants, and its potential and reported implications for
growth and plant productivity, pest infestation, and mitigation strategies and their economic impact.

1. Introduction
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges to the world in present times. It
is deÔ¨Åned as signiÔ¨Åcant changes in the average values of meteorological elements, such
as precipitation and temperature, for which averages have been computed over a long
period [ 1]. The past few decades indicate that signiÔ¨Åcant changes in climate at a global
level were the result of enhanced human activities that altered the composition of the
global atmosphere [ 2]. The concentration of greenhouses gases such as methane (CH 4),
carbon dioxide (CO 2), and nitrous oxide (N 2O) have been increased by 150%, 40% and 20%,
respectively since 1750 [ 3]. Carbon dioxide emissions, which account for the maximum
proportion of greenhouse gases [ 4], rose to 36.14 billion metric tons in 2014 from 22.15 billion
metric tons in 1990 [ 5]. The average global temperature has increased at an average rate of
0.15‚Äì0.20C per decade since 1975 [ 6], and is expected to increase by 1.4‚Äì5.8C by 2021 [ 7].
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly CO 2from the combustion of fossil fuels and
non-CO 2GHGs such as nitrous oxide, methane, and CFCs add to global warming. The
CO 2concentration in the atmosphere had increased to 411.43 ppm in 2019 from 315.98 ppm
in 1959, as shown in Figure 1 [ 8]. CO 2constitutes a major proportion of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere: 65% from fossil fuels and industrial processes and 11% from forestry
and other land use, followed by methane (16%), nitrous oxide (6%), and Ô¨Çuorinated gases
(2%) [ 3]. Before 1750, CO 2emissions from fossil fuels was negligible, but it increased

rapidly with industrialization. Figure 2 shows the increase in CO 2emissions over the
years (1850‚Äì2020). The world has emitted around 1.5 trillion metric tons of CO 2since 1751.
However, there are regional variations in the emission. Europe is the largest contributor
of CO 2having around 514 billion metric tons of CO 2emissions, followed by Asia and the
North American continent, which have recorded cumulative CO 2emissions of 457 billion
metric tons each. The USA is the largest contributor to CO 2emissions (399 billion metric
tons), and has contributed 25% of total historical emissions since 1751, followed by China
(200 billion metric tons). The European Union (EU-28), a union of 28 countries that sets
collaborative targets, has contributed 22% of historical emissions of CO 2. Africa contributes
only 3% of global cumulative CO 2emissions due to low per-capita emissions. However,
countries like Brazil and India, whose historical emission is less, signiÔ¨Åcantly add to the
total emissions in the current context [ 9]. With an increased level of CO 2in the atmosphere,
the fertilization of crops is increased along with decreased energy requirements due to
warming. These are certain positive impacts of climate change, whereas water resources
are negatively impacted due to climate change. In the 20th century, the impact of climate
change was mainly positive. Most countries were beneÔ¨Åtted until 1980, after which the
trend remained the same for the developed world, while the Third-World countries were
negatively impacted. In the 21st century, climate change will become a severe problem,
and both rich and developing countries will face negative externalities [10].

The rise in greenhouse gases has implications for the rising temperature of the atmo-
sphere. These infrared active gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO 2), ozone (O 3), and water
vapor (H 2O), absorb the thermal radiations emitted by the atmosphere and the surface of
the earth, which in turns warms the earth. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse
effect. The average global temperature anomaly is shown in Figure 3, and illustrates a
signiÔ¨Åcant increase in the global temperature compared to the average temperature of the
base period (1901‚Äì2000). The global average temperature has been increased in the range
of 1‚Äì1.2C since 1850. Still, since the temperature changes in landmasses are much more
prominent, the global land temperature has increased around twice that of the oceans.
The temperature of land across the world has risen by 1.32 0.04C compared to the
1951‚Äì1980 average, while the increase was 0.59 0.06C for the ocean surface temperature
(excluding areas of sea ice). Moreover, since the Northern Hemisphere constitutes the
larger portion of landmasses, it has shown a higher average temperature than the Southern
Hemisphere. The temperature of the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere
has risen 1.31C and 0.91C, respectively, with a global average of 1.11C since 1850. The
extreme rise in temperature has been observed in the polar regions, and has detrimental
effects, like glacial melting [ 12]. As the global temperature is rising, there is a need to
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to limit the temperature increase of 2C relative to
pre-industrialization. The developed countries have around a 60‚Äì80% contribution to the
global temperature rise, sea-ice reduction, and upper-ocean warming, compared to 20‚Äì40%
for developing countries, since 2005 [ 13]. The average global temperature is expected to
rise by 2C by 2100 and 4.2C by 2400, as predicted by probabilistic computations of
the IPCC‚Äôs range of climate sensitivity. However, surpassing 2C by 2100 at the present
radiative-force level does not seem likely to happen. But the risk is increasing, mainly due
to the stabilizing of radiative forces above 400 ppm of CO 2. Moreover, it is exceptionally
unlikely that the temperature will rise by 2C if anthropogenic emissions were ceased
tomorrow [14].
Figure 3. Global land and ocean temperature anomalies over the base period (1901‚Äì2000) (source: [15]).
Climate change is projected to worsen in the upcoming future. In the Punjab province
of Pakistan, there have been projections of increased minimum and maximum temperature
in the Kharif and rabi seasons. In Kharif season, the average maximum temperature and
average minimum temperature is predicted to rise by 1‚Äì3.3C and 2‚Äì3C; while in rabi,
it is projected to increase by 2.1‚Äì3.5C and 2‚Äì3C, respectively, in simulations done for
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 1318 4 of 21
the future mid-century (2040‚Äì2069). There have also been projections of variations in
the regions‚Äô rainfall, more emphatically during the Kharif season (25‚Äì35%); while in the
rabi season, the variations are minimal [ 16]. The temperature minimums and maximums
are also projected to rise in Punjab, India by the middle and end of the 21st century, as
estimated by PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies). Moreover, extreme
incidences of high temperature (heat waves) during March to June and low temperatures
during December and January (frost) are also predicted [ 17] The extremes in weather
parameters, mainly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation,
are also projected to be observed more frequently, with higher intensity in China, with
additional warming of 0.5C. Moreover, if global warming is kept below 1.5C, the
weather extremes will be lowered [18].
The global precipitation anomalies over the base period (1901‚Äì2000) are shown in
the Figure 4, which shows that the precipitation change is showing a positive trend, but
these vary according to the region. There was an absolute change of 0.78 inches in precipi-
tation across the world from 1901 to 2015 [ 11]. However, temperature and precipitation
extremes are more likely to be witnessed in the near future due to global warming. Extreme
precipitation phenomena, either heavy rainfall or drought, are dependent on a region‚Äôs
geography. Increased average river Ô¨Çows due to prolonged heavy rainfall are more likely
to be observed in South and East Asia, while the drought in southern Africa and South
America will be less severe. The rainfall pattern of the Indus river basin is projected to
show uneven variations spatially and seasonally. Precipitation is predicted to rise in the
upper Indus basin, while the same has been projected to decrease in the lower basin.
Moreover, the upper basin is also projected to face increased warming than the lower
basin [ 19]. There is a probability of more warm extremes, lesser cold extremes, and more
strengthened precipitation extremes in the future period in the northeastern United States.
Higher emissions will intensify these changes [ 20]. The increased intensity and frequency
of precipitation also impacts soil erosion, and will have more adverse consequences in
northeast China if greenhouse-gas emissions increase [ 21]. Precipitation anomalies have
detrimental effects on agriculture, mainly in developing nations. Apart from affecting
crop yields, it signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuences cropland areas. There is evidence suggesting that
the approximately 9% rate of cropland expansion in the developing world over the last
two decades is due to dry anomalies as farmers expand the area to compensate for yield
losses [ 22]. Global warming will pose a severe threat to the world‚Äôs food security, but if it
is limited to 1.5C, the 76% developing countries‚Äô vulnerability will be reduced compared
with the same regions at 2C [23]. Ensuring food for the world‚Äôs population in the face of
climate change is not an easy task, owing to its huge impact on agriculture production [ 24].
There must be an annual increase in the world‚Äôs agricultural production by 60% from
2005/2007 to 2050, comprising a rise of 77% in developing and 24% in developed countries,
to fulÔ¨Åll the food and nutritional requirements of the population by 2050 [ 25]. Climate
change is known to have an adverse effect on agricultural production, and is projected to
reduce the global cereal production of maize and wheat by 3.8% and 5.5%, respectively [ 26].
Because of climatic factors, plants have to face several abiotic stresses such as salinity,
drought, heat stress, cold stress, etc. [ 27]. Shortage of water availability, soil fertility loss,
and pest infestations in crops are the signiÔ¨Åcant undesirable impacts of climate change [ 28].
This review is an attempt to consolidate the studies related to the impact of climate change
on crop yields, associated weed infestations, and economic consequences for 1998‚Äì2020.
Moreover, mitigation and adaptation strategies to combat climate change are also discussed
to reach a clear understanding of their possible signiÔ¨Åcance.

2. Materials and Methods
A systematic review of the literature was done through PRISMA (Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Meta-Analysis), as shown in Figure 5 [ 29,30]. The studies related to
the research goals were searched on Google Scholar using the following keywords: climate
and agriculture; mitigation and climate change; climate change and economics; mitigation
and economics. Moreover, the search was performed for the years 1998‚Äì2020. A total of
410 documents were screened, out of which 200 papers were found to be relevant. Research
papers published in journals having an impact factor were Ô¨Ånally selected, and their results
are reported here.

3. Causes of Climate Change
Temperature changes are caused by natural phenomena and anthropogenic activities
on earth, which ultimately initiates the concentration of GHGs [ 31]. Anthropogenic activi-
ties lead to the emission of greenhouse gas such as CO 2, methane, and nitrous oxide, as
well as other substances that lead to ozone depletion in the atmosphere [ 32]. The increased
CO 2concentration in the atmosphere can affect microbial activities in the soil, along with
implications on water content, and therefore increased atmospheric CO 2(463‚Äì780 ppm) can
stimulate nitrous oxide and methane emission from upland soil and wetlands, respectively,
which nulliÔ¨Åes the 16.6% mitigation effect of climate change as predicted by increasing ter-
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 1318 6 of 21
restrial carbon sink [ 33]. The agriculture sector contributes 15% of total emissions, primarily
methane and nitrous oxide. The global emission of non-agricultural greenhouse gases
is predicted to rise until 2055 if the dietary preferences and consumption of food energy
are kept constant at 1995 levels. However, with changing preferences toward high-value
foods such as milk and meat, the emissions are predicted to rise at an even higher rate.
The emission can be reduced either with technological mitigation or by reduced meat
consumption, or both [ 34]. The livestock sector is the main contributor to greenhouse-gas
emissions, and according to the IPCC, it generates around 8‚Äì10.8% of emissions; however,
it can contribute up to 18% of GHG emissions based on lifecycle analysis [ 35]. The main
sources of greenhouse-gas emissions by the livestock sectors include enteric fermentation,
N2O emissions, liming, fossil fuels, organic farming, and fertilizer production [ 36]. The
use of nitrogenous chemical fertilizers also leads to greenhouse-gas emissions [ 37]. With
better management of crop production, N fertilizer use can be lowered by 38%. Better crop
management also leads to consumption of 11% less input energy with 33% increased yields,
leading to a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% [38].
4. Climate Change and Agriculture
Agriculture is the most vulnerable sector to climate change, owing to its huge size
and sensitivity to weather parameters, thereby causing huge economic impacts [ 39]. The
changes in climatic events such as temperature and rainfall signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the yield
of crops. The effect of rising temperatures, precipitation variation, and CO 2fertilization
varies according to the crop, location, and magnitude of change in the parameters. The
temperature increase is found to reduce the yield, while the precipitation increase is
likely to offset or reduce the impact of increasing temperature [ 40]. As inÔ¨Çuenced by
climatic variables when witnessed in Iran, crop productivity depends on adaptation abilities
and crop type, climate scenario, and CO 2fertilization effect [ 41]. The net revenue of
farmers is found to decrease signiÔ¨Åcantly with a decrease in precipitation or increase in
temperature in Cameroon. This factor and poor policy-making have led to low demand
for Cameroon‚Äôs agricultural exports, thereby causing Ô¨Çuctuations in national income [ 42].
Statistical evidence shows the temperature affects coffee yield in Veracruz, Mexico. It was
also found that coffee production may not remain economically viable for the producers in
the coming years, as there is an indication of a 34% reduction in current production [ 43].
The effect of climate change on the crop yields vary according to the area and irrigation
application. Crop yields can be increased by expanding irrigated areas, which can have a
detrimental effect on the environment [ 44]. The rise in temperature is likely to reduce the
yield of many crops by reducing their duration [ 45]. The aggregate production of wheat,
rice, and maize is expected to decrease if both the temperate and tropical regions experience
a warming of 2C [46]. Climate change in general has more impact on tropical regions,
as tropical crops remain closer to their high-temperature optima, and thereby experience
high-temperature stress during elevated levels of temperature.
Moreover, insect pests and diseases are more prevalent in humid and warmer re-
gions [ 47]. Other parameters such as humidity and wind speed, along with temperature
and rainfall, also impact crop yields, and in the absence of these parameters, there has
been a chance of over-prediction of the cost of climate change. Moreover, it was found
that climate change is likely to reduce the yields of wheat, corn, and rice in China by
18.2612.13 ,45.1011.55 , and 36.25 10.75% until 2100 [ 48]. Extreme weather events
have become more frequent since the 1900s in the Netherlands, and have signiÔ¨Åcantly
affected the wheat yield in the Dutch region. The week in which an extreme weather
event occurred determined the extent of yield reduction in wheat [ 49]. There has been a
projection of higher droughts in the near future due to climate change in most of the regions
of the world, and an increase of drought-affected area from 15.4 to 44.0% is projected by
2100. Africa is cited as the most vulnerable area. The yield of major crops in drought areas
is expected to be reduced by more than 50% by 2050 and by almost 90% by 2100 [50].
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 1318 7 of 21
The loss of crop yields can increase food prices, and can have an absurd effect on
agriculture welfare globally, with a 0.3% annual loss of future GDP globally by 2100 [ 51].
However, [ 52] found that climate change has limited inÔ¨Çuence on the world food sup-
ply, but the developing countries will face severe negative consequences. In India, the
temperature is predicted rise between 2.33C and 4.78C along with a doubling of CO 2
concentration and longevity of heat waves, which could have a detrimental effect on the
agriculture sector [ 53]. In the arid region of Rawalpindi, Pakistan, an annual loss of INR
4180/acre is to be borne by farmers by 2100 with a 1C increase in temperature, while the
net revenue can be increased by INR 377.4 and INR 649.21 with an increase in rainfall of 8%
and 14%, respectively [ 54]. The yield losses in three cereal grains (rice, maize, and wheat)
are projected to worsen by 10 to 25% with a 1C increase in mean surface temperature
globally [ 55]. In sub-Saharan Africa, the average crop yield is projected to be reduced
by 6‚Äì24% due to climate change [ 56]. The total Ô¨Åsh demand in Solomon Island is also
projected to exceed the production in 2050, which will have serious implications for food
security, as per-capita consumption will be reduced [57].
Plant‚Äìwater relations are highly susceptible to changes in temperature and precipi-
tation, and physiological changes are more likely to be impacted by extreme changes in
these parameters than by changes in mean climate [ 58]. Plants‚Äô response to climate change
varies according to the plant species and developmental stage of the plant. There are
species-speciÔ¨Åc thresholds for different plants, and their responses, such as elongation of
roots, disturbance in growth angle of roots, and reduction in yield, vary among different
species of plants [ 59]. With increased CO 2content in the atmosphere, reduced transpiration
was found in plants, leading to an increase in air temperature of 0.420.02 K . This indi-
rect physiological effect of raised CO 2and a direct radiative effect can increase warming
of land surfaces by 3.33 0.03 K [ 60]. With a rising CO 2level in the atmosphere, the
harvestable produce of crops are expected to increase, and the developmental changes in
plants depend upon the type of crops. C 3crops are expected to produce more, however,
the water requirements of both C 3and C 4crops are expected to be lowered in the absence
of stressful conditions. But these beneÔ¨Åcial impacts of raised CO 2are likely to be offset by
elevated temperatures and altered precipitations [61].
However, a positive impact of climate change on agriculture production is also ob-
served in some areas. But these regional changes, whether increases or decreases, would
not result in massive changes, and these changes will be more prominent in some low
latitudes only. However, if the temperature is increased beyond that equivalent to doubled
CO 2, this can cause substantial economic losses [ 62]. The detrimental impact of climate
change will be enormous in developing countries‚Äô tropical regions, but it will largely
depend on the region‚Äôs climate scenario. The drier region of Sri Lanka (north and east)
will experience huge losses in agriculture compared to the cooler central highland region,
the output of which is expected to remain the same or even increase with rising temper-
atures [ 63]. The pace of climate change determines its impact, thereby determining the
cost of adjustment, so environmental policies must be dynamic and implemented with
adaptation and Ô¨Çexibility [64].
A sensitivity analysis using CERES (crop estimation through resources and environ-
mental synthesis) has also shown that wheat and rice yields in northwest India have the
potential to increase by 28% and 15%, respectively, at double the levels of CO 2; however,
the increased thermal stress due to elevated level of temperatures associated with high
CO 2nearly cancels out the positive impact. Moreover, there will be an increased yield in
both rice and wheat by 21% and 4%, respectively, if the irrigation scheduling followed at
present is practiced even under the combined effect of enhanced CO 2and thermal stress.
But in case of acute water shortage along with thermal stress, the yield of rice and wheat
is projected to decline even under the positive inÔ¨Çuence of raised CO 2in the future [ 65].
The increased CO 2concentration has the potential to offset the losses in the crop yields
due to rising temperatures and reduced soil moisture [ 66]. The raised CO 2concentration
considerably reduces the global yield losses by mainly decreasing agricultural consump-
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 1318 8 of 21
tive water use (4‚Äì17%). Moreover, the crop yields‚Äô regional differences are mostly due to
different crops‚Äô growing environments [ 67]. The concentration of nutrients (N, Fe, Zn, and
S) mainly found in proteins is reduced in non-leguminous C 3crops with an elevated level
of CO 2[68]. At the increased level of CO 2, enhanced vegetative and reproductive growth
and enhanced seed yield are observed in rice crops at an ambient air temperature of 29C;
however, with increased temperature, the seed set was decreased [69].
At an elevated level of CO 2, the zinc and iron content of C 3grain crops and legumes
are decreasing, which has detrimental effects on human health. C 3plants and legumes‚Äô
protein concentration is also observed to be lowered, while C 4plants are unaffected by
a raised CO 2level [ 70]. The changes in climate also impact the microbial population
present in the soil, and their enzymatic activities. When assessed from a temperature-
gradient tunnel with a 4‚Äì5C higher temperature, the microbial population was found
to be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than in Ô¨Åeld conditions. The population of nitrogen-Ô¨Åxing and
P-solubilizers bacteria and fungus, as well as enzymatic activities, were signiÔ¨Åcantly higher
under a wide range of temperatures, but the highest parameters were found on or near
the optimum temperature [ 71]. In contrast, the growth of endophytic fungus and plant-
growth-promoting bacteria has a positive, negative, or neutral impact, depending on the
temperature range [ 72]. The impact of climate change on various crops‚Äô productivity as
estimated through various models is shown in Table 1.

Projected changes in climate are most likely to affect the development and survival
of pathogens [ 81]. The change in climate or weather pattern of an area is predicted to
increase a crop‚Äôs susceptibility to various pests, diseases, and weeds. Increased yields are
projected in countries of high and mid-latitudes, while yields are projected to decrease at
lower latitudes [ 82]. However, there are projections of a 10‚Äì25% increase in losses due to
insect pest infestation with an increased temperature of one degree [ 83]. Climate change
has the potential to increase the pest population and its migration, which can have an
adverse impact on agricultural yields and even viability, as the pest population depends
mainly on abiotic factors such as humidity and temperature. In Brazil, the infestation of
coffee nematodes and leaf miners is expected to increase due to an increase in the number
of generations in a month compared to the climatic conditions of 1961‚Äì1990 [ 84]. Pest
infestation thereby has led to huge pesticides costs for pest management. There is statistical
evidence that increased rainfall and temperatures increased the costs of pesticides for crops
such as corn, potatoes, and soybean, in contrast to a reduction in wheat in the USA [ 85].
The ratio of arable land affected by the European corn borer and the Colorado potato
beetle is expected to increase by 43 and 48%, respectively, for the second generations in
HadCM3-high 2050 scenario, and the unoccupied areas of high altitudes are also found
vulnerable to these pests in the scenario of increasing temperature in Central Europe [ 86].
In the current global-warming scenario, an expansion of the suitable areas for wheat aphid
(Schizaphis graminum ) has been predicted to upper latitudes in northern hemisphere by
2030 while in northern hemisphere, the area is predicted to contract [ 87]. The frequency
of the insect outbreak of 30 pest species is also expected to rise. It is likely to affect new
areas with the increasing temperature in Sweden and affect its forestry sector [ 88]. The
future projection of the potato tuber moth ( Phthorimaea operculella ) when done through GIS
modeling, reported an estimated increase in the pest‚Äôs damage potential in tropical and
subtropical warmer regions, where the pest already prevails. It is also predicted to expand
in temperate and mountainous regions, with a slightly increased damage potential [89].
The life cycle of pathogens such as Puccinia striiformis f.sp. trictici is projected to be
limited by increasing temperature, while an increase in the concentration of atmospheric
CO 2is estimated to provide advantageous conditions for Fusarium pseudograminearum [90].
Climate change impacts the geographical distribution and growth rate of populations, along
with increasing the number of generations. Climate change can extend the development
season of the pests and change the synchronization of crop and pest. It can also increase the
risk of migrant pest invasion. The efÔ¨Åciency of plant protection measures such as host plant
resistance, natural enemies, transgenic plants, synthetic chemicals, or biopesticides are also
likely to be reduced due to climate change [ 91]. There could be unpredictable interactions
of cropping systems, weather, and pests due to climate change and globalization [ 92].
Climate change is likely to impact insects‚Äô growth and their metabolic rates, particularly
in temperate regions [ 55]. The region of suitability of pest infestation is also increasing
because of climate change. The three common insect species of Africa, Tuta absoluta, Ceratitis
cosyra , and Bactrocera invadens , have increasing habitat suitability across the entire continent,
particularly in regions close to its most suitable habitat [93]. Moreover, the increased CO 2
level and the rising temperature are increasing the threat of late blight of potato, blast, and
sheath blight of rice, which could pose a serious threat to the world‚Äôs food security [94].
Weed infestation of crops is also affected by climate change. C 3weeds respond more
strongly to an increase in CO 2concentration, with increased leaf area and biomass. C 3
weeds are a major problem in C 4plants, while C 4weeds in C 3plants become less competi-
tive [ 95]. Weeds compete with crops for water and nutrients, as they have higher nutrient
requirements than the crop plants [ 96]. Climate change also inÔ¨Çuences the dynamics of
crop‚Äìweed competition. Apart from weed growth, climate change also signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çu-
ences herbicide efÔ¨Åcacy, as it affects the herbicidal mode of action [ 97]. Climate change is
projected to have a favorable inÔ¨Çuence on the weeds of wheat crops, which are very vital
to world food security [ 98]. In the wake of climate change, new geographical horizons are
being opened up for weeds, and their management can only be possible if new manage-
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 1318 11 of 21
ment practices are being planned while considering climate change. Pest infestations of
various crops is predicted to worsen with climate change, as warmer and humid conditions
are more favorable to pest proliferation. However, it will vary from region to region and
according to the pests‚Äô adaptability to climate change.
5. Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change
Farmers‚Äô perceptions of climate change‚Äôs threat and severity have the most impor-
tant motivational factor in voluntary mitigation. However, the adaptation depends on
the availability of related information [ 99]. Moreover, there will be a reduction in the
number of people exposed to water stress with mitigation strategies, but the remaining
people will need adaptation strategies due to their exposure to increased stress [ 100].
The usage of traditional management systems and agroecological management systems,
namely biodiversiÔ¨Åcation, soil management, and water harvesting, can help farmers adopt
climate-resilient technologies [ 101]. These management practices ensure increased car-
bon sequestration, increased soil health, increased soil quality and reduced soil erosion,
leading to resilient soils and cropping systems, ultimately ensuring food security during
climate change [ 102]. These educational interventions, which focus on local, tangible,
and actionable aspects, and could be monitored by individual behavior, are the most
successful in providing climate-change education for ecological development [ 103]. The
farmers were basically in support of adaptations, but the GHG reduction is endorsed by
only a few, which shows the need to focus on interventions having both the features of
adaptation and mitigation [ 104,105]. The main adaptation methods of mitigation can be
broadly classiÔ¨Åed into resource-conservation technologies, cropping-system technologies,
and socio-economic or policy interventions [ 106]. Small and marginal farmers are not able
to cope with climate change due to less awareness, which makes them more susceptible to
losses [ 28]. The farmers of African countries are also very vulnerable to climate change due
to Ô¨Ånancial implications and lack of management strategies [ 93]. There have been ways to
curb the impact of climate change by a number of agronomic practices, such as a shift in
sowing dates. The optimum sowing dates for wheat have been identiÔ¨Åed as October 22‚Äì28
in the northeastern part, October 24‚Äì30 in the central region, and October 21‚Äì27 in the
southwestern region of Punjab, India [ 107]. The yield loss of the crops is lowest when the
farmers have adopted sequential cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa, and adjust the
sowing dates according to climate [ 108]. The agroforestry sector can mitigate GHG accu-
mulation in the atmosphere, and thus help small farmers of Kenya adapt to climate change.
There are certain simple approaches to decreasing GHG emissions, such as alternate drying
in rice, mid-season drainage, improved livestock diet, increasing N-use efÔ¨Åciency, and soil
carbon. Simple adaptation strategies like changing planting dates and varieties have the
potential to decrease the impact of climate change [ 109]. Diffusion of technology is very
important in shaping the response of farmers to climate change. The main priority areas
are market integration and support of public research and capacity-building [110].
Conservation agriculture has the potential to reverse the degradation caused by con-
ventional tillage over the years, as it leads to minimum soil disturbance, crop diversity, and
maintenance of soil cover. Moreover, conservation agriculture leads to lower GHG emis-
sions, reduced fertilizer use, and higher terrestrial carbon sequestration [ 111]. Minimum
soil disturbance, crop rotation, and soil cover are the underlying principles of conservation
agriculture that pave sustainable agriculture methods. In south Asia, farmers are adopting
zero tillage for wheat cultivation primarily because of a 15‚Äì16% reduction in cultivation
cost. Moreover, zero tillage leads to higher yields with lesser variability in wheat and
maize [ 112]. No-till practices were also claimed as an alternative to conventional tillage,
which mitigates the impact of climate change through carbon sequestration; however, its
impact in the mitigation of climate change is exaggerated, as the additional organic carbon
in no-till cultivation is very small [ 113]. There have been various factors responsible for
the adoption of conservation agriculture (CA), namely perception of individual beneÔ¨Åts,
functional market exchange techniques to supply the mandatory resources for CA im-
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 1318 12 of 21
plementation, economic motivation for farmers, development of farmer organizations to
encourage local adaptation, and the creation of a suitable environment by alliances of
farmer organizations and institutions [114].
The means to adapt to climate change are mainly modiÔ¨Åed farm practices, and are
inÔ¨Çuenced greatly by the policy decisions suiting the climatic variability and climate
extremes, along with social, political, and economic conditions [ 115]. The conventional
intensiÔ¨Åcation of agriculture causes huge economic losses, out of which almost 80% are
caused by mismanagement of nutrients, which makes nutrient management an important
aspect [ 116]. Carbon sequestration, or an increase in soil organic carbon (SOC), can be
encouraged by no-till farming, cover crops, manuring, nutrient management, agroforestry,
and soil restoration. Moreover, carbon sequestration can reduce 5‚Äì15% of fossil-fuel
emissions globally [ 117]. Direct-seeded rice (DSR) causes fewer GHG emissions compared
to transplanted rice. Dry DSR and wet DSR have 76.2% and 60.4% lower potential for
global warming, respectively, in comparison to transplanted rice. Moreover, wet DSR also
produced a 10.8% higher yield than transplanted rice [118].
Aerobic rice also has a huge potential in the mitigation of future climate change, as it
saves 73% of irrigation water used in land preparation and 56% water used in the period of
crop growth. Cultivation of aerobic rice by using micro-irrigation technologies is a suitable
method for sustainable rice production. It also helps in reducing methane emission from
rice Ô¨Åelds [ 119]. There could be possible shortage of fresh water available for irrigation in
the western US, China, and south, west and central Asia, which could lead to the conversion
of 20‚Äì60 million ha of irrigation area to rainfed area, and cause a loss of 600‚Äì2900 pcal in
food production [ 120]. Drip irrigation is one of the irrigation techniques being promoted to
reduced groundwater overdraft and shocks induced by climate change. It has the potential
to be resilient to climate change, and reduces the demand of groundwater for irrigation. But
farmers are using drip irrigation for intensive agriculture, leading to further groundwater
overextraction, causing Jevons paradox [ 121]. Water-saving irrigation techniques such
as sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation can help mitigate and adapt to climate change,
and provide sustained economic beneÔ¨Åts. However, the incremental cost of mitigation in
sprinkler irrigation is reported to be highest i.e., USD 476.03‚Äì691.64/t due to water-pressure
requirements, which could add to GHG emissions [122].
Agricultural practices based on site-speciÔ¨Åc information can help in reduced N appli-
cation without lowering proÔ¨Åtability. Precision agriculture is therefore considered more
proÔ¨Åtable than management of whole Ô¨Åeld [ 123]. In northwestern India, inefÔ¨Åcient fertil-
izer management by farmers has led to lower nitrogen use efÔ¨Åciency. A leaf color chart
(LCC) was found very suitable to improve the time and fertilizer rate. Upon application of
fertilizers, when the LCC showed less than 4 shade, the produced rice yield was on par
with the recommended blanket dose of 120 Kg N/ha [ 124]. Application of fertilizers in rice
at LCC 4 decreased methane and nitrous oxide emissions by 11% and 16%, respectively,
over conventional N fertilizer application in split doses. In wheat, it led to 18% lower
nitrous oxide emissions compared to conventional N fertilizer application [ 125]. Adoption
of laser land leveling (LLL) has led to increased crop yields and farmer income. In the
Raichur district of Karnataka, it was reported that LLL has raised the yield of paddy crops
by 0.5 metric tons/ha, which can led to an upsurge in net farm income of INR 5000/an-
num. It has also reduced cultivation costs and conÔ¨Åned the losses caused due to climatic
variability [ 126]. Breeding of plants to form new varieties can be one way to cope with en-
vironmental stresses. This will require germplasm selection, shortening of breeding cycles,
and multilocation trials to test a variety‚Äôs suitability to the target environment [ 127,128].
As climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of abiotic stress, it is
important to generate stress-tolerant varieties as a mitigation strategy. The cloning of the
SUB1A gene in rice plants has facilitated the incorporation of the gene into various high-
yield varieties released in South Asian countries. These submergence-tolerant varieties
produce a higher yield than the original varieties after being submerged for 18 days [ 129].
Climate smart agriculture (CSA) aims to adapt to climate change by adopting several
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 1318 13 of 21
interventions, including water-smart practices, nutrient-smart practices, weather-smart
activities, carbon-smart activities, and knowledge-smart activities. Climate-smart agricul-
ture builds resilience to climate change by building evidence, enhancing local institutions‚Äô
effectiveness, promoting agricultural policies according to climate, and linking agricultural
Ô¨Ånancing to climate [130].
Most efÔ¨Åcient climate-smart technologies are those which either provide nutrients
or water, or support soil structure. In semiarid West Africa, some technologies, namely
half-moons, stone bunds and zai, and nutrient application were found suitable for main-
taining food production and securing smallholder farmers [ 131]. Climate-smart agriculture
technologies were studied in Punjab, Pakistan, and a higher productivity of cotton with
higher returns and higher resource-use efÔ¨Åciency was observed [ 132]. The Indo-Gangetic
plain is very vulnerable to climate change, which has adverse effects on the rice‚Äìwheat
cropping of the area. Farmers have expressed their willingness to adopt climate-smart
agriculture technologies that can transform conventional agricultural practices into more
productive technologies. Laser land leveling (LLL), weather-advisory services, and crop
insurance are the most-preferred CSA technologies of the eastern indo-gangetic plains
(IGP), while the farmers of the western IGP mainly prefer direct seeding, LLL, zero tillage,
crop insurance, and irrigation scheduling [ 133]. These mitigation strategies have huge
mitigation and adaptation potentials. However, they depend upon the suitability of a
technology to the region, people‚Äôs perception, economic viability, and technical complexity.
Moreover, these strategies work well when a number of interventions are used together in
solidarity with each other.
6. Economic Impact of Climate Change and Climate-Smart Agriculture Technologies
Climate change has initially had certain positive impacts, but the environment‚Äôs
unavoidable warming is a negative externality. A rise in temperature beyond 3C has
net negative results, and more than 7C can cause total welfare loss. The world‚Äôs social
cost of carbon emission is expected to be USD 29/tC (tonnes of Carbon) in 2015, and to
raise at 2% per year [ 134]. The net economic gains in the Ô¨Åshery sector of Solomon Island
would be considerable if mitigation strategies for climate change are adopted. Climate
change also will severely affect agricultural markets, causing a reduction of 0.26% in global
GDP [ 135]. There would be a projected annual loss of 0.2‚Äì1% in household welfare if
the climate predicted for the 2080s occurred today [ 136] Both market and non-market
damages increase in quadratic progression and are expected to cost 1.2% of GDP with a
1C increase in mean global temperature [ 137]. If future mitigation strategies follow the
adaptation of strategies used in the past, global income is projected to show a 23% decrease
by 2100 and a wider gap in income inequality [ 138]. Global economic growth is projected
to be reduced by 0.28% per year [ 139]. The economic beneÔ¨Åts of various climate-smart
agriculture technologies can be seen in Table 2.

7. Conclusions and Prospects
An increasing population has put a lot of pressure on agriculture to ensure the food
and nutritional security of the world, which is further worsening with climate change.
Even though there are uncertainties regarding the future climate scenario and its possible
impacts, various studies report that climate change will decrease agricultural productivity
in the coming years. The key factors of climate, namely temperature, precipitation, and
greenhouse gases, signiÔ¨Åcantly hampered pest infestation, soil fertility, irrigation resources,
physiology, and plants‚Äô metabolic activities. A number of mitigation and adaptation
strategies have been developed to offset the deleterious impact of climate change on
agricultural sustainability. These technologies include water-smart practices (laser land
leveling, rainwater harvesting, micro-irrigation, crop diversiÔ¨Åcation, raised-bed planting,
direct-seeded rice), nutrient-smart practices (precision nutrient application, leaf color
charts, crop residue management), weather-smart activities (stress-tolerant varieties, ICT-
based agrometeorological services), carbon-smart activities (zero tillage, legumes, crop
residue management) and knowledge-smart activities (agricultural extensions to enhance
capacity-building). These technologies signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce the effects of climate change on
crops, and make them more suited to the climate by minimizing the unfavorable impacts.
Climate change is predicted to cause huge economic losses at both the micro and macro
levels that can be mitigated through these interventions. But these interventions must be
organized at the regional or local level to improve their efÔ¨Åcacy. Mitigation and adaptation
strategies are expected to increase farmers‚Äô income without compromising agricultural-
production sustainability. The future of climate change and its associated impacts is highly
unpredictable, which makes planning for mitigation and adaptation a bit complex. This
necessitates the formulation of climate-resilient technologies involving an interdisciplinary
approach according to the region. Suitable varieties need to be developed that could
adapt to climatic variations, along with planned agronomic management and crop pest
control. Farmers need to be educated regarding various climate-smart technologies, and be
provided training to simplify their use at the Ô¨Åeld level.
Keynotes:
1. Greenhouse-gas emissions at the global level are raising the CO 2content in the
atmosphere, raising the global temperature due to greenhouse effect. However,
landmasses have witnessed a higher increase in temperature than oceans.
2. The precipitation scenario is altered, and more weather extremes are projected to be
witnessed in the near future.
3. Climate change is projected to have a deleterious impact on agricultural productivity.
The raised temperature and altered precipitation are most likely to offset the positive
impact of increased CO 2on plants.
4. The warmer and humid climate created due to climate change is creating more
horizons for pest infestations.
5. Those climate-resilient technologies that are technically sound and economically
viable must be framed using an interdisciplinary approach to mitigate climate change.
